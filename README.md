# Tetra Face

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

The idea for this project is to create a multiplayer game where users can log in, chat, and play against each other. While Tetris is often recommended as a simple game to build, it is actually trickier than you would assume.

Refer to this for the Tetris rules:
